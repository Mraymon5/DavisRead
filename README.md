# DavisRead
Code for interpreting Davis Rig .ms8.txt files

Consider all of this a work-in-progress.

Included are two scripts, one for R and one for Python, that each contain a function for interpreting .ms8.txt files.
Using the R file is fairly straightforward; in a separate analysis script, use source("path/to/Davis_Read.r") to run that script, which will add a function to your environment that does the interpretation.

TBD on the python script. I think it's functional, but I don't yet know the best way to use it.
